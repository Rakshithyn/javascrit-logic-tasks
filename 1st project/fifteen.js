/* Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator. */


let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a *= 5;
b *= b;
c *= 10;

/* a should equal 25.
b should equal 36.
c should equal 46.
You should use the *= operator for each variable.
You should not modify the code above the specified comment. */
