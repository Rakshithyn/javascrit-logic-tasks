 Compound Assignment With Augmented Division
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator. 
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;
Only change code below this line
a /=  12;
b /=  4;
c /=  11;

Waiting:a should equal 4.
b should equal 27.
c should equal 3.
You should use the /= operator for each variable.
You should not modify the code above the specified comment.
